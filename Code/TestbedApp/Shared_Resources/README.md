#  Game Data

Textures used across all platforms are contained in the shared asset catalog `Shared.xcassets`; those that
are platform-specific are contained in the app's own default catalog, `Assets.xcassets`.

All game data that isn't bitmaps images (textures) or sound, i.e. all the data that is represented as text/JSON
is stored in resource files wit the appropriate name and extension, under the `Game_Data` directory.
